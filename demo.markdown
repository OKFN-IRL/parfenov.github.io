Hi,

I’m Denis Parfenov. I am a social entrepreneur and an OKFN Ambassador for Ireland. I come up with ideas, work out the way to realise them and and turn ideas into realities.

I work on #OpenGov #OpenData #ogpIRL #opendataIRL

I founded ActiveCitizen, a grassroots, politically neutral community initiative which builds bridges between citizens and their governments through technology tools, communications and advocacy. Our work resulted in a commitment of the Irish government to participating in the Open Government Partnership.
